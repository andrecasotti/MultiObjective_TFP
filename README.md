# A multi-objective formulation for the team formation problem using Krippendorff's disagreement and sociometric cohesion with Pareto-solutions obtained via evolutionary algorithms
This repository contains the source code used in the paper "A multi-objective formulation for the team formation problem using Krippendorff's disagreement and sociometric cohesion with Pareto-solutions obtained via evolutionary algorithms" by Andr√© L.N Casotti and Renato A. Krohling. The formulation was based on Pymoo, a general-purpose and very robust framework for optimization problems.
